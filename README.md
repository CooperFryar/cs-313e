# CS 313E - Elements of Software Design
## About
This is my repository containing all content related to the course, CS 313E, from the University of Texas at Austin. This course is taught by Dr. Shyamal Mitra and explores algorithms, data structures, object oriented programming paradigms and design concepts. 
### Assignments
This is the bulk of the work. Each assignment subfolder containts a script to run the Python code as well as the html file for accessing the problem in case of the source link being unavailable.

### Exams
This folder contains questions and solutions from the three semester exams (there is no final).
- [Exam 01](https://github.com/maxwellmattryan/cs-313e/blob/develop/exams/exam-01.py)
### Exercises
This work was not necessary, but I found it helpful to write data structures from scratch along with methods for searching, removing, inserting, sorting, and so forth. To run the code inside this folder:
- [Data Structures](https://github.com/maxwellmattryan/cs-313e/tree/develop/exercises/data_structures)
- [Algorithms](https://github.com/maxwellmattryan/cs-313e/tree/develop/exercises/algorithms)
```
cd <path.../cs-313e/exercises>
python testing.py
```
Simply open up the testing script to modify or change any test parameters.
### Lectures
Not entirely that important or relevant, but sometimes Dr. Mitra will write code in class. He also posts most if not all it at some later point.
